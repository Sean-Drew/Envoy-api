# Envoy - Express API

This application allows users to post messages and images to a discussion board
so they can share their content and interact with other posts from other users.

## Planning Story

As a group we chose to tackle the message board prompt and we decided to try
and reproduce a simplistic version of a Reddit-like message board. We began our
work on the project by building the backend Express API. As a group we decided
to group code the mongoose models for the resources that we would need API
routes for. Once we built the models to our satisfaction, we split up the work
of creating CRUD routes for each respective resource. Once we had a fully
tested and functioning backend we started brainstorming the React.js frontend.

We faced a few challenges when trying to populate a nested mongoose document and
we were eventually able to resolve this as a group by reading the mongoose
documentation and doing some trial and error. Another interesting challenge
arose when the API was sending back a 500 status error when a user tried to
change a resource that didn't belong to them. While we were getting the desired
behavior on the front-end, we had to go back into our error_handler file and
make sure that our custom OwnershipError was included in the errors which would
return a status 401 unauthorized.

The biggest challenge and learning point from this project was understanding
how to effectively work together in a group and how to manage a common repo to
which we were all contributing on a daily basis. While we had to inevitably go
on a few LONG tangents as a group in order to solve merge conflicts in our local
repos we were able to work well as a unit and this is reflected in the final
product for this project.
